# linux-in-practice-in-Rust

A practical reimplementation of inline examples from the book "Linuxのしくみ" in Rust.
This project is for learning both Linux internals and Rust by porting example programs written in Python and Go to Rust.

## Goals
- Port inline example code from each chapter of "Linuxのしくみ" to Rust to reproduce in Rust.
    - Understand Linux kernel behavior.
    - Learn basic Rust language concepts.
- Practice English through code, commit message, and pull request descriptions.

## Repository layout
- chap01/, chap02, ...: chapter-by-chapter Rust ports and examples.
